This extension helps you see which activities happened since you last visited GitHub and which one you've already seen, and it does so by dividing your activity feed into two sections.

Available for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whats-new-on-github/ldleapnlgbkpkabhbkkeangmnfpikahe) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/whats-new-github/).

## Reminders (for myself)

### Zipping

```bash
WNGH_VERSION=X.Y.Z
cd whats-new-github/
zip whats-new-github-v$WNGH_VERSION.zip icon/128.png icon/48.png index.js manifest.json
mv whats-new-github-v$WNGH_VERSION.zip ..
cd ..
```
